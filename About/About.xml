  <description><![CDATA[<b>Cheers 4 Hobbits!</b>

Mod for RimWorld that treats humanlikes with body size less than 1.0 as body size 1.0 (same as humans) for the purposes of drug addiction and tolerance, effectively no longer penalizing them for their body size.

Although this mod was originally intended for Lord of the Rims Hobbits, it works with all humanlikes with <1.0 body size.

Note that body size is not changed, so all the many other effects from body size (such as food needs, carrying capacity) are unchanged.
